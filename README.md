# Final-Year-Project-AI-Based-Text-Interactive-ChatBot

A minor project submitted by Shaleen Singh, Harsh Gupta, Anjali Chauhan, and Pooja Pandey in December 2020.

# 📌 Abstract

This project demonstrates the development of an AI-based Text Interactive Chatbot designed to simulate human-like conversation through a text-based interface. The chatbot retains conversation context (stateful interaction), enabling it to respond naturally and efficiently. Designed with user experience in mind, it aims to offer a fun, intuitive, and fast interaction process — minimizing human effort and ensuring quick resolution of user queries. It can also be integrated into web platforms to enhance customer support for small businesses and industries by automating common tasks and reducing operational costs.

# 🎯 Objectives

    Build a text-based chatbot using AI/ML and NLP techniques.

    Ensure smooth and stateful interaction flow between the user and bot.

    Develop a chatbot interface that is user-friendly, efficient, and context-aware.

    Showcase how chatbots can replace or enhance apps/websites for specific services.

# 💻 Technologies Used
